# Notes
### Command Permissions
All of these Slash and Context Commands can be restricted to only be used by specific Users/Roles, in specific Channels, or by everyone everywhere in Server Settings > Integerations.

Sadly, though, this Settings Page is only viewable on Desktop and Web Browser versions of Discord, not Mobile App versions.

Furthermore, some of these Commands, such as `/lockemoji`, have default Permission requirements set - meaning that they won't be viewable or usable in the Command Pickers unless you have the relevant Permission (or are Server Owner, or have Admin Permission); unless an override has been set on the Command itself by the Server's Admins/Owner.

### Context Commands & Where to Find Them
By now, most Users are aware of Slash Commands (`/boop` for example) and how to use them - but not many are aware of Context Commands. Hence, this section here to explain where they are!

__Message Context Commands__ are Commands used on a specific Message in Chat, and can be found:
- **Desktop/Web:** Right-click a Message -> Apps
- **Mobile:** Long-press (press-and-hold) a Message -> Apps

__User Context Commands__ are Commands used on a specific User in Servers, and can be found:
- **Desktop/Web:** Right-click a Username or profile picture either in Chat or Member List -> Apps
- **Mobile:** Long-press (press-and-hold) a Username or profile picture in Chat or Member List -> Apps

# Questions
## Why did you make this Bot?
> This Bot was born from a mixture of "felt like it" and a want to bring back some of the commands from the Kawaii Bot (that was discontinued when I originally made this Bot, but apparently has made a return in 2022?).
> 
> Now, TwilightZebby aims to make this a *real* general purpose Discord Bot - focusing on actual 'general' features (meaning, no music functions, no levelling, no moderation).
> 
> The Bot, with its original name of "Actions Bot", was originally first added to [Dr1fterX's](https://www.twitch.tv/Dr1fterX) Server in January 2021. The Bot was later renamed to "MooBot" in March 2022; and renamed again to "HeccBot" in May 2023.

## Why was the Bot renamed from "Actions Bot" to "MooBot"?
> The original name, "Actions Bot", was picked because of the simple nature of the bot - to add action-based Slash Commands.
> Now that the Bot is being used for more features, which are less action-based (such as Button-Roles or the Temperature Convertor), TwilightZebby thought a name change was in order since "Actions Bot" isn't accurate anymore.
>
> "MooBot" became the name picked as a reference to an *old* meme in [Dr1fterX's](https://www.twitch.tv/Dr1fterX) community, in which TwilightZebby was a cow (yes, as in the animal).
> That meme has long since vanished as per TwilightZebby's request. He humbly requests no one refer to him as a cow anymore because of the expiry of that meme. :)

## Why was the Bot renamed from "MooBot" to "HeccBot"?
> Due to Discord changing their [Username System](https://dis.gd/usernames) in early 2023, it was thought that the name "MooBot" could not be used for this Bot anymore, since it is already taken by a verified Discord & Twitch Bot.
> 
> Thus, TwilightZebby renamed this Bot to "HeccBot". However, Discord has since allowed Bots to stay on the old username system (with "username#0000" style names including discrims) - but TwilightZebby will keep the Bot named as "HeccBot" to help reduce conflicting names with the aforementioned Twitch Bot.
